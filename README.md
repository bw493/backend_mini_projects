# Back-End Development Mini Projects

This repository contains mini projects to help beginners understand back-end development concepts. These projects cover topics such as web servers, database integration, and deployment.

## üìù Summary of Concepts

Back-end development involves handling server-side logic, databases, authentication, and API communication. This guide covers:

1. Setting up a basic server
2. Connecting the back-end to a **database** (SQLite, MongoDB)
3. **Deploying** the back-end to a live server
