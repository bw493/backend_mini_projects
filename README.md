# Back-End Development Mini Projects

This repository contains mini projects to help beginners understand back-end development concepts. These projects cover topics such as web servers, REST APIs, database integration, authentication, and deployment.


## 📝 Summary of Concepts

Back-end development involves handling server-side logic, databases, authentication, and API communication. This guide covers:
1. Setting up a basic server using **Flask (Python)** or **Express (Node.js)**.
2. Creating a **REST API** to send and receive data.
3. Connecting the back-end to a **database** (SQLite, MongoDB).
4. Implementing **user authentication** using JWT.
5. **Deploying** the back-end to a live server.


## 📌 Mini Projects

### **1️⃣ Basic Web Server**
- **Goal:** Create a simple server that returns "Hello, World!"
- **Skills:** HTTP request handling, local server setup.
- **File:** [`netrunner_helios.py`](./netrunner_helios.py)👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- This is written based on flask, but the following projects are going to be basedon Django.

#### 🔹 **What I Built**
I created a **basic web server** using Python and Flask. It listens for incoming requests and responds with `"Hello, World!"`. This is the foundation of any web application.

### **2️⃣ Simple REST API**
- **Goal:** Build an API with `GET` and `POST` requests.
- **Skills:** API creation, handling JSON responses.

This project focus on:
✅ **Setting up Django from scratch**  
✅ **Creating a REST API using Django**  
✅ **Handling database integration (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)**  
✅ **Implementing user authentication (JWT, Django Auth)**  
✅ **Deploying a Django app to production (Heroku, Render, etc.)**  


### **3️⃣ Database Integration**  
- **Goal:** Store and retrieve data using a database.  
- **Skills:** Database connections, CRUD operations.  

This project focuses on:
✅ Setting up and configuring your database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)  
✅ Designing and managing Django models and migrations.  
✅ Implementing full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
✅ Utilizing Django ORM for efficient database interactions.  
✅ Optimizing queries and indexing for improved performance.  
✅ Securing data with proper backups and restoration strategies.


### **4️⃣ Deploy a Back-End App**
- **Goal:** Deploy a server to **Heroku** or **Render**.
- **Skills:** Deployment, environment variables, production readiness.
